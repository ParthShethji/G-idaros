### Main Objectives/Goals:
To develop and implement a bridge that allows Greenfield data to be mirrored across different EVM chains or Layer 2 solutions. The bridge should ensure easy sharing, reuse, and integration of data, while providing flexible access management to maintain security and control.

### Challenge Description:
This grant invites developers to implement a bridge for moving Greenfield data between different Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains and applications. The goal is to enable seamless data sharing, access management, and integration across multiple EVM chains or Layer 2 solutions.

### Resource Mirroring:
Enable data mirroring from Greenfield to different EVM chains or Layer 2 solutions.
Ensure data can be easily shared, reused, and integrated across multiple chains and applications.
Flexible Access Management:
Implement a robust access management system that allows fine-grained control over who can access the data and under what conditions.
Ensure the access management system is flexible and easy to use, enabling secure and controlled data sharing.
